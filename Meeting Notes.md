# Today Meetings:

## Introduction
During a training session with Samim and our new staff, we conducted an introductory session to familiarize them with our training program and the significance of the Training Manual Guide. We emphasized the importance of the manual as a comprehensive resource for learning about various processes and procedures within our organization.

## Connecting PCs to Azure Active Directory
In a subsequent meeting with our new staff, we provided a training session on connecting our PCs to the Azure Active Directory. We guided them through the steps required to establish a secure and efficient connection, ensuring seamless access to cloud-based resources and enhancing overall productivity and collaboration within our organization.

## Power Automation AI with Chat GPT
During a meeting with Mr. Hackney and our teammates, we explored the application of Power Automation AI and its integration with Chat GPT. Mr. Hackney introduced the concept of using Format Data by Example to train Chat GPT in order to automate problem-solving tasks. By inputting the first number and relevant data, Chat GPT can generate solutions, alleviating the need for manual intervention.

This integration of Chat GPT within Power Automation provides us with the ability to streamline workflows and focus on more strategic challenges. It enables us to leverage AI technology to automate problem-solving, saving valuable time and resources.

## Conclusion
These training sessions and meetings underscored the importance of the Training Manual Guide, highlighted the process of connecting PCs to Azure Active Directory, and showcased the integration of Chat GPT within Power Automation for efficient problem-solving. By equipping our staff with the necessary knowledge and tools, we empower them to contribute effectively to our organization's success.
